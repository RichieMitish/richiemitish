  <strong>USE CASE</strong> <br><br>

  <strong>Problem</strong><br>
  Since the company's products were distributed worldwide, it did make sense to put out video instructions on certain actions so that the owners would not have to deal with text translations or even text instructions at all.<br><br>
  
  <strong>Solution</strong><br>
  For each device model, a few videos were recorded showing how to perform common actions and also those that statistically raised questions among the device owners.<br>

## Replacing a cartridge

<!-- Video on a common action for a certain device model (all of them had cartridges yet they weren't the same). -->

## Adjusting brightness

<!-- Video on certain option for this device model only (other models' controls were different). -->
