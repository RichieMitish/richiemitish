  <strong>Request</strong><br>
  Marketing and BP team requested for a "happhy holidays" text with an announcement about something new to be released very soon.<br><br>
  
  <strong>Solution</strong><br>
  The card's main point had to be that announcement, so the text was a very simple and common one. And the announcement was hinting on the new device's key feature (that had later won the Red Dot Design Award 2019) being its clear and minimalistic design.<br><br>

  Design and illustrations for the card were created by a designer.<br><br>
