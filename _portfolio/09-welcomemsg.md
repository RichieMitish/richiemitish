  <strong>USE CASE</strong> <br><br>

  <strong>Problem</strong><br>
  Support team and other departments of the company reqiured information about the devices purchased in different parts of the world and in different stores to, among other reasons, provide the device owners with a proper warranty service.<br><br>
  
  <strong>Solution</strong><br>
  As a part of the RMA (return merchandise authorization) management, the welcome message was written. All the company's products were supplied with it printed out on a nice paper, making it possible for every new owner to register their device. <br>
  The registration could be done using the online form that the message's link and QR code were leading to. Once finished with the form, the device owner was offered with a discont code for their future purchases. <br><br>
