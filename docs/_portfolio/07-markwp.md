  <strong>Request</strong><br>
  Marketing team was creating a whitepaper on a certain topic. The request was to write the part of the whitepaper that would show what had to be done to achieve the goal in question and how exactly the platform helped with it.<br><br>
  
  <strong>Solution</strong><br>
  Included in the <em>"Cutting costs on UA management with JustControl.it"</em> whitepaper.<br> 
  I described a flow of a few steps, highlighting key points and benefits of using the platform as a solution. One of the steps is shown below on this page.<br><br>
  
  In the whitepaper, mine was that part's text only. Illustrations were created by a designer using my sketches and references.<br><br>
