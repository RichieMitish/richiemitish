## Summary 

Hey!

A few more interface features for you today: view your stats by weeks or months on the go using the date granularity option, see your metric’s total with no calculations and, finally, drop the habit of counting how many days it’s been since that particular date when setting the
relative date range.<br>

And, of course, a couple of new modules including the one that supports TikTok’s new API and the SKAdNetwork data collection.<br>

See further details below.
