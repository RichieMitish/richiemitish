So which device of ours to choose? They are based on the same evaporative working principle that's proven itself over the years. Having our patented **EvaBreeze** material inside, Evapolar devices get the fullest out of this entirely natural cooling technology. Having different sets of features, each of them is ideal for certain needs.
