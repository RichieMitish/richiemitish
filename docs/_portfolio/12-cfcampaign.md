  <strong>USE CASE</strong> <br><br>

  <strong>Problem</strong><br>
  Having thousands of crowfunding campaign hardware product perks to fulfill, the campaign founder had to keep those thousands of backers updated on how the things were going with the product. Crowdfunding campaign page had a dedicated section for such updates which were also getting sent out to each backer via email (unless unsubscribed, of course). This channel was also often used to inform backers about current promos, discounts, etc.<br><br>
  
  <strong>Solution</strong><br>
  Posting regular updates with the most recent info and updates.<br>
  See the text of one of them below on this page.<br><br>
